# Customer Churn Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python.  
The objective is to understand customer behavior, identify key factors contributing to churn, and derive data-driven insights that can help improve customer retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall customer churn rate  
- Identify churn patterns across customer tenure and contract types  
- Study the impact of services and customer support on churn behavior  
- Extract actionable insights to reduce churn and improve retention  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level information related to:
- Contract type  
- Customer tenure  
- Internet service type  
- Payment method  
- Support and security services  
- Demographic attributes  

The target variable is **Churn**, indicating whether a customer has discontinued the service.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Methodology
- Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand structure, data types, and missing values  
- Cleaned the data by handling null values and correcting inconsistencies  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using aggregation, grouping, and visualizations  
- Analyzed churn behavior across multiple features such as tenure, contract type, services, and payment methods  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Overall churn rate is approximately **26.5%**, indicating a significant retention challenge  
- Highest churn observed among **month-to-month contract customers**  
- Customers in the **early tenure period (1–2 months)** show higher churn rates  
- Lack of **tech support, online security, device protection, and backup services** is strongly associated with higher churn  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Improve onboarding experience for new customers  
- Promote support and security services to reduce churn  
- Encourage long-term contracts to improve customer retention  
- Focus retention strategies on high-risk customer segments  

---

## 📌 Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in Python-based exploratory data analysis  
- Improved ability to interpret data patterns and business implications  
- Strengthened skills in data visualization and analytical storytelling
